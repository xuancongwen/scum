# Scum

This game is also known as [Presidents](https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/presidents) apparently.

This is a learning project that uses some open source card assets to learn Godot.

## Requirements

- Godot 4+ (C# is optional, though not used in this project)
- Shouldn't need a high end computer (this is being developed on an M1 Max Macbook Pro), unless we screwed something up
